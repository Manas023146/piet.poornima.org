    <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 40px; font-size: 20px;">Intellectual property plays an important role in providing a competitive edge to any Institution. The
        tangible assets like inventions, designs, software, brand name and other creative & innovative ideas
        are more valuable than physical assets. PIET IPR Cell is committed to encourage, protect, manage
        and commercialize Intellectual Property such as Patent, Copyright, Trademark etc. generated
        through the College. The cell creates conducive environment in the academics for the development
        of Intellectual Property. Faculty and students of PIET are actively participating in the IPR filing
        process in different disciplines of Engineering & Technology.</p>

    <h1 class="heading-h2 text-center text-light" style="background-color: black;">Importance of IPR</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 40px; font-size: 20px;">It is necessary to protect the Intellectual property in order to enable organizations to earn recognition
        or financial benefits. Governments of various countries protect the innovative ideas of the inventors
        through Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). Recently, IPR has become a central issue in the
        developed and developing countries. The rationale for this IPR lies in the need to create awareness
        about the importance of IPRs as a marketable financial asset and economic tool among the
        researchers, faculty and students of the College. Intellectual property Rights: means the rights
        derived from the IP e.g. Patents, registered designs, copyright etc.</p>
