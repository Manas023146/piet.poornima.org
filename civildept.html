    <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 40px; font-size: 20px;">Welcome to the Civil Engineering Department at Poornima Institute of Engineering and Technology, Rajasthan! Situated in the heart of Rajasthan, our department is dedicated to shaping the next generation of civil engineers poised to lead the industry with expertise, innovation, and a commitment to sustainable development. Departmental efforts to foster well-rounded professionals are founded on a dedication to excellence and include stakeholder support networks, outcome-based education, and new educational policies. With a focus on academic excellence, our comprehensive curriculum integrates core engineering principles with creativity and critical thinking, delivered by experienced faculty through interactive lectures, practical workshops, and hands-on projects. Our state-of-the-art facilities, including laboratories for construction and road materials testing, surveying, geotechnical engineering, and structural analysis, provide students with invaluable practical experience. 
    <br><br>The Department of Civil Engineering was incepted in the year 2007 with the vision, “To serve the Nation by providing high quality engineering education that enables students to get a profession that can improve the civil infrastructure and social welfare.”
    <br><br>I am glad to inform that Department has been accredited by National Board of Accreditation (First Private College in Rajasthan) in year 2019-20 and got compliance till session 2022-23 it and so now in elite list of departments in India which has got this accreditation. Because of this it is now recognized to confirm the best practices and benchmarks in engineering. It was possible because of dedicated mentors and bright students.
    <br><br>Industry Partners, Alumni Networks, Governmental Agencies, and Academics Form the Backbone of the Civil Engineering Department's Stakeholder Support System. By maintaining close relationships with these groups, the department can better meet the needs of businesses, encourage students to work together on research projects, and expose them to possibilities and difficulties that they will face in the real world. Educational programs are made more relevant and effective via regular feedback methods.
    <br><br>The department takes a student-centered approach and places an emphasis on outcome-based education to ensure that graduates have the skills, knowledge, and character traits needed to succeed in their careers. Curriculum goals include the development of students' critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and ethical-values capacities via the establishment of specific learning objectives and evaluation criteria. Graduates are equipped to tackle modern engineering difficulties and make a significant impact on society via continuous review and adaptation.
    <br><br>The Civil Engineering Department follows the New Education Policy's tenets, which include an emphasis on multidisciplinary study, adaptability, and creativity in the classroom. Curriculum efforts are focused on incorporating new technologies including digital modeling, and sustainable design approaches. Also, students are encouraged to build a spirit of lifelong learning, participate in experiential learning, and study many disciplines of knowledge as part of the holistic development program.
    <br><br>Students will gain a broad grasp of engineering principles as well as expertise in transportation systems, environmental sustainability, construction management, and structural engineering. Students may participate in a wide variety of seminars, workshops, internships, and field trips in addition to their regular course of study. Participation in these activities enhances their education, helps them grow as leaders, and encourages them to get involved in their local communities.
    <br><br>The department provides a variety of value-added courses that are designed to meet the needs of the industry, as it understands the need of continuously improving one's skills.
